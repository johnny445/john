GIT BRANCH: git cherry-pick <commit id>
GIT CHERRYPICK: It is the act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another.
                It can useful for undoing changes. git cherry-pick <commit id>
			    If a commit is accidentally made to the wrong branch. you can switch to the 
				correct branch and cherrypick the commit to where it should belong.
				Cherry picking is the act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another.
ANSIBLE ROLES: A role directory structure contains directories: defaults, vars, tasks, files, templates, meta, handlers. 
               Each directory must contain a main.yml file which contains relevant content.
HANDLERS:      contains handlers which can be invoked by “notify” directives and are associated with service.

JENKINS: Jenkinsfiles, using a domain specific language based on the Groovy programming language, 
         are persistent files that model delivery pipelines “as code”, containing the complete set of encoded steps 
		 (steps, nodes, and stages) necessary to define the entire application life-cycle.
JENKINS (SCRIPTED PIPELINE VS DECLERATIVE PIPELINE): 
         The key difference between Declarative pipeline and Scripted pipeline would be with respect to their syntaxes and their flexibility.
         Declarative pipeline is a relatively new feature that supports the pipeline as code concept. 
		 It makes the pipeline code easier to read and write. 
		 The scripted pipeline provides huge control over the script and can manipulate the flow of script extensively.
		 The scripted pipeline is a traditional way of writing the Jenkins pipeline as code. 
		 Ideally, Scripted pipeline is written in Jenkins file on web UI of Jenkins.
		 This helps developers to develop advance and complex pipeline as code.
		 This code is written in a Jenkinsfile which can be checked into a source control management system such as Git. 
         The declarative pipeline is defined within a block labelled ‘pipeline’ whereas the scripted pipeline is defined within a ‘node’. 		 
		 
DOCKER CGROUPS : (Control groups)CGROUPS INVOLVE RESOURCE METERING AND LIMITING:
                   MEMORY
                   CPU
                   BLOCK I/O
                   NETWORK.
SELINUX:   Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a security architecture for Linux® systems that 
           allows administrators to have more control over who can access the system. 
           SELinux defines access controls for the applications, processes, and files on a system. 
           It uses security policies, which are a set of rules that tell SELinux what can or can’t be accessed, 
	       to enforce the access allowed by a policy. 
AUTO SCALING: VERTICAL SCALING means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine. 
               AWS provides instances up to 488 GB of RAM or 128 virtual cores.
S3 LIFE CYCLE : An S3 Lifecycle configuration is a set of rules that define actions that Amazon S3 applies to a group of objects. ... 
                For example, you might choose to transition objects to the S3 Standard-IA storage class 30 days after you created them, 
			    or archive objects to the S3 Glacier storage class one year after creating them. 
                Lifecycle rules to define actions that you want Amazon S3 to take during an object's lifetime 
                (for example, transition objects to another storage class, archive them, or delete them after a specified period of time).

What is Soft Link And Hard Link In Linux?
A symbolic or soft link is an actual link to the original file, whereas a hard link is a mirror copy of the original file. 
If you delete the original file, the soft link has no value, because it points to a non-existent file.

 S3 ENCRYPTION TYPES
1. Rest encryption (Server Side Encryption (SSE))
2. Client-side encryption
3. transit encryption

 GIT Branching strategy
 
 master branch - stable (production code)
 development branch - pre production code
 feature branch - 
 release branch - preperation of new production release
 hot fix - patch production releases.

DEFINE AND EXPLAIN THE THREE BASIC TYPES OF CLOUD SERVICES AND THE AWS PRODUCTS THAT ARE BUILT BASED ON THEM?
THE THREE BASIC TYPES OF CLOUD SERVICES ARE:

1.Computing
2.Storage
3.Networking

Here are some of the AWS products that are built based on the three cloud service types:
Computing - These include EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, Auto-Scaling, and Lightsat.
Storage - These include S3, Glacier, Elastic Block Storage, Elastic File System.
Networking - These include VPC, Amazon CloudFront, Route53.
